(In areas above 2000 metres elevation (6,500 feet), the risk of Zika infection through mosquito bites is very low.) In addition to the infectious risks of any destination, it is important to consider the standard of available healthcare, and the availability of obstetric and neonatal specialist support (should it be required). Sexual transmission of Zika virus is possible and is prevented through the use of condoms. Many health authorities including the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">United States CDC</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/2nd-emergency-committee-zika/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a> advise pregnant women not to travel to areas with active transmission of Zika virus.</p>\n<p>What is Zika?</p>\n<p>Zika is a viral illness that is mostly spread via mosquito bites, although sexual transmission occurs. Four out of five people infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are usually mild - fever, rash, muscle and joint pains, and red eyes (conjunctivitis), similar to many other viral illnesses including flu, dengue and chikungunya. Most people recover fully in about a week. Occasionally neurological complications including \"Guillain-Barr syndrome\" (a potentially severe muscular weakness) occurs. Irreversible severe birth defects, including \"microcephaly\" (a small head with severe brain and developmental abnormalities) can occur in the babies of women infected during pregnancy. There is no specific treatment and no vaccine. Prevention is through avoidance of mosquito bites and sexual transmission.\n</p>\nFor more information:<br/>\n<ul> <li>See the International SOS Zika website.</li> <li>Contact any International SOS assistance centre.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"

Members should expect further bellicose rhetoric and provocative acts by North Korea amid heightened regional tensions. However, such acts do not indicate an overall deterioration in the travel security environment and travel to South and North Korea can continue.</p>\n\n<p><p><b>Advice</b></p><ul> <li>Travel to South Korea and North Korea can continue. Monitor developments prior to and during your stay for any deterioration in bilateral relations and associated risks.</li> <li>Tour visits to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) can continue. Visits are strictly controlled and will be quickly halted in the event of a deteriorating security environment.</li> <li>Members in South Korea should seek itinerary-specific advice prior to travel to the disputed islands of Yeonpyeong, Baengnyeong, Daecheong, Socheong and Woo; follow any evacuation orders issued by the authorities.</li> <li>Members planning to travel to North Korea should obtain a brief prior to departure on the unique circumstances and practical difficulties. The importance of this brief is amplified by the severe limitations on receiving reliable, timely information in the country.</li> <li>Monitor our alerts to remain apprised of related developments. Contact your nearest Assistance Centre to seek itinerary- and profile-specific advice.</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p><p><b>More detail</b></p>The launch comes amid an ongoing annual US-South Korean Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises, which began on 1 March and will continue until late April. North Korea frequently conducts missile and nuclear tests around the annual military exercises and important anniversaries. The latest missile launch was the second such incident this year; North Korea fired a medium-range ballistic missile off its eastern coast on 12 February. Previous nuclear tests and missile launches have prompted the imposition of UN-led and bilateral international sanctions on North Korea, which, in turn, is liable to prompt further bellicose rhetoric from the North.<br/>\n<p>Further provocative acts are increasingly probable until the joint exercises conclude, and if the US goes ahead with its plans to deploy an anti-missile defence system in South Korea. Nonetheless, the latest developments should not be viewed as a prelude to a military confrontation between North Korea and the US, South Korea or Japan. Precedents also indicate that North Korea may carry out small-scale and localised acts of military provocation ‚Äì including exchanges of artillery fire ‚Äì along the DMZ and the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea (West Sea). However, such incidents are unlikely to target civilian areas on the mainland.</p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>]]>"
